                    Lately, I've been a bit more interested in the C++ language. Though I've dabbled with it, I've never
                    been formally instructed on it. So I took a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213"> Udacity course </a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Since our final project was a project of our choice, I decided to recreate Pacman.
                    I've done an <a href="../angular-pacman">Angular Pacman</a> project before, so I figured I could focus on the aspects of coding
                    that were specific to C++, and not worry too much about implementing the logic. (And I could steal images and what-not from my old project, too!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The code is available <a href="https://github.com/kenk42292/pacman">here</a>. I won't go into the details of the implementaion here, as the
                      README in the project repo is decently thorough, and the code is fairly self-explanatory.
                    </p>
